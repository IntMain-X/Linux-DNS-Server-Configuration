@     IN    SOA  ns1.yourCustomDomain.com.   admin.yourCustomDomain.com. (
              3   ; Serial
         604800   ; Refresh
          86400   ; Retry
        2419200   ; Expire
         604800 ) ; Negative Cache TTL
;
@     IN    NS      ns1.yourCustomDomain.com.

10.  After that press on your keyboard ctrl+o and then ctrl+x or ctrl+x then y and again ctrl+x to save file and exit that file
11.  Next in terminal enter: sudo nano /etc/bind/named.conf.local and hit enter then remove all content from that file and paste this line of code:

zone "yourCustomDomain.com" {
    type master;
    file "/etc/bind/db.yourCustomDomain.com";
};

zone "1.168.192.in-addr.arpa" {
     type master;

};

12. After that press on your keyboard ctrl+o and then ctrl+x or ctrl+x then y and again ctrl+x to save file and exit that file
13. In terminal enter: sudo systemctl restart bind9 and press enter 
14. If you want to check if it is working or not in terminal enter: sudo systemctl status bind9

15. This is optional but it's useful to have (linux firewall) if you dont have one you can enter in terminal: sudo apt install ufw
Or if you want to have graphical user interface you can enter:  sudo apt install gufw 
Next to check if it is working in terminal enter:  sudo systemctl status ufw 
If terminal print: Status: inactive in terminal enter:  sudo ufw enable   and check again status of ufw (firewall) and you will see: Status: active
Last step is to allow bind9 to go throu your linux firewall you can do that entering in terminal: sudo ufw allow bind9
Than reload firewall entering in terminal: sudo ufw reload  then the terminal will print: Firewall reloaded

Now your DNS server is ready for use.
